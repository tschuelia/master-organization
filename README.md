# master-organization
This tool is intended to help me organize my master's degree courses at the University of Karlsruhe (KIT). 

Implements among other things: 
* Checking of Categories
  - e.g. In order to finish the studies at least 9 credits are required in the minor subject.
* Pre-planning of courses
* Calculation of average grade total, per category and per semester
* Experimenting with the average grade by enabling or disabling courses

## Usage

## Using the codebase
Install the requirements with
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
